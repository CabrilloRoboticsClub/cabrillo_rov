# bouyancy

this is the arduino code for the vertical profiling float

a component of the 2022 mate rov competition

we build a tube with a bladder that we fill and empty with water to change the bouyancy of the tube.

if this was a real vertical profiling float it would have sensors as well but its just simulating the motion
